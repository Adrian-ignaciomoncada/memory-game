# The Odin Project 2021 Game Jam - Matching Game

This is an entry for The Odin Project's [2021 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/top-jam-1). Our team is @Adrian.Moncada, @gabesenacom, and @Ubercj.

The theme is "Edutainment," and we decided to make a memory matching game.


simpleMemoryGame
Create an array with the diferent cards


Click on a card and a picture will appear.
Click on another different card and it will open.
If the cards match , they remain open , if not they close again.
Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all cards are open. Then the game ends.

1. Create an array with the card's like items. 
2. In the array put the name and the img route

Create te simple board UI. For this we will need
A loop that goes through every element array and creates first  a var to store data for the cards
a) atributes src for the images
b) id for the cards
c) a event when clicked run a function for fliping the card

Check for matches
1. If the same card is clicked -> alert you click the same card
2. If two of the same cards are clicked -> alert you found a match!
3. If none of the above happened -> Try again

Create the function to flip the card
1. funct flipCard will get the id of the chosen card and reveal the image inside the id
