            The goal of Memory Game is to move your ranger past every single other player's ranger, stealing a life from each one as you go by them. The first player to collect all of the lives wins.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game is played in turns, with players attempting to move their rangers down the pathway. On a player's turn, they look at the image on the next tile in front of their ranger. The player then flips over one of the face-down tiles. If the tile that was flipped over shows the same image as the next tile in front of the ranger, the player moves forward one space on to that tile, and then repeats the process with the next tile. When the player flips over a tile with an image that does not match the next tile in front of their ranger, their turn ends and their ranger goes no farther.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's ranger, and the player succeeds in matching that tile, their ranger "leapfrogs" over the ranger in front of them to land on the next tile in front of that player, and in the process steals all lives that the other ranger had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the lives, that player wins the game.
